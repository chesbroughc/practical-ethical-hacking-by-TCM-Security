Five Stages of Ethical Hacking

1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
      Active and Passive:
          -Active - Scanning for ports, services, and vulnerabilities
          -Passive - Google dorking, Social media, etc. (indirect)
          
2. Scanning and Enumeration (Active Recon)
      -Using tools like Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto to actively scan clients; looking for open ports and vulnerabilities
      -Hunting for items of value
      
3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)
      -Exploiting a vulnerability to gain access to a machine, network, etc.

4. Maintaining Access
      -Finding ways to remain inside of a network/machine
      -Hunting for backdoors
      
5. Covering Tracks
      -Delete accounts you created (cleaning up)
      -Delete logs you left behind
      -Delete any malware you uploaded
